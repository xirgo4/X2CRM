// this file contains css shared between desktop and PhoneGap x2touch
// It will *not* be included when x2touch fetches CSS assets from X2CRM, since x2touch has a local
// copy. Consequently, important style changes added to this file that belong in the PhoneGap client
// will need to be deployed in an Android/IOS application update.
