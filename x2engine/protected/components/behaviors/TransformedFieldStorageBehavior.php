/**
 * Base class for behaviors which store attributes in a different form than
 * when the model and its attributes are loaded.
 *
 * Its purpose is to be used in cases whenever the stored value in the database
 * will be different in some way from the value of the attribute when it is
 * loaded in the model. For example, storing a JSON string in a database record,
 * and having the corresponding model attribute be the decoded JSON object as
 * an associative array. Thus, the transformation is transparent and requires no
 * extra action in the code where the model is being used.
 *
 * In all child classes, methods {@link unpackAttribute()} and
 * {@link packAttribute()} must be inverses of each other. In other words, given
 * a value X, the value returned by unpackAttribute(packAttribute(X)) should be
 * identical to X. This ensures that the storage of the data does not modify the
 * data, one critical requirement of all database-driven software. Exceptions
 * can be made only if any loss or addition of data is intentional and stops
 * after a certain number of iterations of packing and unpacking.
