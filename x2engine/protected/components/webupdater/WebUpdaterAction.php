 * enable updating it to the latest version pre-emptively without harming any
 * other part of the application with incompatibilities. For this reason,
 * coupling between actions and the controller is intentionally kept very loose

 * with the exception of "error500" (which was in AdminController as of the
 * switch to the new self-contained updater utility).
 *
 * References to the application singleton and controller are thus accompanied
 * by or wrapped in a slew of conditional statements for purposes of backwards
 * compatibility.
