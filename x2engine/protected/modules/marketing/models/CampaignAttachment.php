/**
 * A Campaign represents a one time mailing to a list of contacts.
 *
 * When a campaign is created, a contact list must be specified. When a campaing is 'launched'
 * a duplicate list is created leaving the original unchanged. The duplicate 'campaign' list 
 * will keep track of which contacts were sent email, who opened the mail, and who unsubscribed.
 * A campaign is 'active' after it has been launched and ready to send mail. A campaign is 'complete'
 * when all applicable email has been sent. This is the model class for table "x2_campaigns".
