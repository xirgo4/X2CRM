 * 
 * Permissions have been refactored to break the traditional inheritance structure
 * and have more granular controls. This script serves to fix older versions.
 * 
 * Originally, the permissions system had a strict inheritance structure where
 * each level of access implicitly granted each level of access "below" it where
 * Admin > Delete > Update > Create > View
 * Now, each permission can be granted individually and so older systems need
 * the links between permissions broken up and a little extra fiddling to make
 * them still functional in the new system.
