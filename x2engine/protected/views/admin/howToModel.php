<h2>DEPRECATED</h2>
<h2>Add A Field To The Database</h2>
<p>
    Regenerating models is a necessity when adding fields to the database, so after
    you read this, read the post on how to use Gii if you haven't already.  Adding
    a field to the database simply requires you to use whatever way you have of connecting
    to your database (client, command-line, etc.) and either using a query or built in tool
    to add the field.  The issue then arises because X2 Engine isn't configured for that 
    field and needs to be changed.  Read the tutorial on using Gii to learn how to do this.
