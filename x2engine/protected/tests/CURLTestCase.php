 * Non-database web request test case.
 *
 * This is hideously duplicated code from {@link CURLDbTestCase} because PHP
 * does not natively support mixins, and since we're working with child classes
 * of the PHPUnit framework classes, Yii behaviors are not an option. A distinct
 * class for doing non-database URL tests is necessary for performance's sake.
 *
 * Note, the one difference is that this uses TEST_WEBROOT_URL instead of
 * TEST_BASE_URL, to permit testing outside of X2Engine, i.e. ad-hoc scripts.
