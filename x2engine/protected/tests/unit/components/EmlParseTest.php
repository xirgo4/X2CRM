Thank you for forwarding me that email; it allowed me to capture the raw format and generate a new pattern so that the forwarding use case will support Zimbra\'s attached forwarded message format. This pattern will formally be included in the next release, but I have taken the liberty of loading it into the database on your VPS so that it will be available right away.

FYI, all VPS customers get the email dropbox functionality automatically set up for them during the provisioning process. As described in the installation
wiki article on its setup, doing it manually involves a few extra server-end configuration steps. Not having to deal with that is one major advantage of our VPS hosting.

To use the email dropbox:

Method 1: Send an email *to* the contact and, in the CC field, put dropbox@testdomain.com, and it will be appended to the contact record as an email-type action. It\'s similar to what I\'m doing with this email. Method 2: Forward an email sent *from* the contact directly to dropbox@testdomain.com, and it will be appended to the contact record as a note-type action ("contact sent email")

If you have any suggestions or feature requests, or run into any problems, please do not hesitate to ask. You can email me at this address, or submit a support case, or ask on our forums (at x2community.com, where we\'ll grant you access to the private priority forum).

Thank you so much for purchasing a hosted account with X2Engine! My name is Haley, and I am a Sales and Marketing Representative. Please feel free to reach out to me at any time. We appreciate your business and are looking forward to working with you. You should have already received an email that will take you through the set up process for your virtual private server.

For access to your X2Engine Virtual Private Server (VPS), you will be granted a free subdomain of x2vps.com of your choosing in addition to the one it is given initially. If you own a domain name that you wish to user for your VPS, you may use that as well. To specify a subdomain name or associate a domain name with your VPS, please send an email to customersupport@x2engine.com or open a support case , beginning the subject/description with "Domain name change:"

As to the dropbox, here is a short video about how to use the functionality:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ltkwgGvXvs

Essentially, after set up, you can BCC or CC your dropbox (as I did on this email) and X2Engine will recognize the email and attach the correspondence onto the account record.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions, concerns or comments you may have. I would be very interested to hear about your company and how you decided on X2Engine. I look forward to hearing from you, and I hope you enjoy using X2Engine!

Thanks for the email, we will start looking at the software this afternoon. I have worked with Sage Act and Goldmine CRM software in the past, however I never felt “comfortable” with either one.

Quickly here is what I am looking for:

·        I work as a sales rep/marketing manager in the fly fishing, which is a small, niche industry. So staying on task and maintaining a constant relationship with my customers is very important.

·        My total # of contacts is less than 5000

·        Most of my sales are done via phone and email, however I do travel.

·        We produce 1-2 email campaigns each month, to specific, regional and national customers

·        The majority of my larger customers (800) are contacted via phone 2-3 times each year, plus client specific emails.

·        All customers in data base receive email from us

·        We do have a website(s)

·        Developing a sales pipeline with a task manager is important

·        Email integration?

Access via Android?

Suggestions?

As of now I’m looking for a CRM for myself, however several of the companies I consult for are also looking for software.

I appreciate your time.. have a great day!
